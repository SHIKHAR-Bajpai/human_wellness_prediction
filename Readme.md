# Personalized Wellness AI

This project explores the design and implementation of a proof-of-concept for a Personalized Wellness AI. The aim is to demonstrate how machine learning can be applied to understand and provide insights into an individual's daily well-being based on various lifestyle factors.

## Project Overview

The core idea behind this project is to create a system that can analyze a user's daily habits and predict aspects of their wellness, such as their mood. By identifying patterns and correlations, the AI can potentially offer personalized recommendations to foster healthier living. This repository contains the foundational work for such a system, focusing on the machine learning pipeline from synthetic data generation to model evaluation.

## Key Features

* **Synthetic Data Generation:** A custom dataset is generated to simulate realistic daily wellness metrics, including steps, sleep duration, mood, dietary intake, stress levels, hydration, screen time, and social interaction.

* **Mood Prediction Model:** A machine learning model is developed to predict a user's mood score based on the generated wellness features.

* **Data Visualization:** Key insights from the synthetic data are visualized to illustrate relationships between different wellness factors.

* **Model Evaluation:** The chosen model's performance is rigorously evaluated using appropriate metrics to assess its predictive capabilities.

* **Ethical Considerations:** The project also delves into the potential real-world impact, risks, and ethical considerations associated with deploying a personalized wellness AI.

## Technical Approach

### Data Design

The synthetic dataset is carefully constructed to reflect plausible correlations and variability found in real-world wellness data. Features are designed with assumed positive or negative impacts on mood and stress, and Gaussian noise is introduced to simulate natural fluctuations.

### Machine Learning Model

The core ML problem addressed is **mood prediction**, framed as a regression task. A **Random Forest Regressor** was selected for this purpose due to its ability to handle non-linear relationships, robustness to outliers, and its capacity to provide valuable feature importance insights.

### Evaluation Strategy

The model's performance is evaluated using standard regression metrics:

* **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**

* **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**

* **R-squared ($R^2$) Score**

A **train-test split** validation approach is employed to assess the model's generalization capability on unseen data.
